        I have been working for more than 12 years in many fields as a Sales
        Agent, Manager, and Assistant Manager in the CRM department and have
        experienced most recently 3+ years as a Senior Educational Counselor in
        multiple companies.
        <br />
        Good Communication, Team Leading, Team Management, Achieving Goals,
        problem-solving, challenging-hard-working, and Time-management are now
        my habitual characteristic. I love to work organized way always.
        learning new things makes me happy by born. I am self-employed and
        disciplined. I believe that discipline is the master key to success.
        <br />
        Now I have finished a very popular and well-trained base web-development
        6 months-long course. I have done some projects too using some very
        demanding technologies like (tailwind.css, BS, Javascript, React, and
        Node.js. MongoDB.) I am very passionate about a web development career
        and growing and building my skills by practicing and doing something
        real constantly.
